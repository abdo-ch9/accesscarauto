# üö® Quick Fix for Production

## Immediate Solution

Your frontend at `accesscarauto.com` is trying to connect to `localhost:5000` which doesn't exist in production.

### Option 1: Use a Temporary Backend (Quick Test)

I can help you deploy a temporary backend quickly. Update your frontend's API URL to:

```typescript
// In src/services/api.ts, change line 1-4 to:
const API_BASE_URL = 'https://aero-car-store-backend.vercel.app/api';
```

### Option 2: Deploy Your Own Backend (Recommended)

1. **Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com)**
2. **Create new project**
3. **Upload your `backend` folder**
4. **Add these environment variables:**
   ```
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://abdelchpro_db_user:aRwH1vHSEqXyFQ1c@caraccessauto.5inb8j3.mongodb.net/aero-car-store
   JWT_SECRET=aero-car-store-production-secret-2024
   FRONTEND_URL=https://accesscarauto.com
   ```
5. **Deploy and get your URL**
6. **Update frontend API URL to your new backend URL**

### Option 3: Use Railway (Alternative)

1. **Go to [Railway](https://railway.app)**
2. **Connect GitHub and select backend folder**
3. **Add environment variables (same as above)**
4. **Deploy**
